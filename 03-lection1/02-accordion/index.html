          <span class="accordion__text">Bicameral mentality would be non-conscious in its inability to reason and
            articulate about mental contents through meta-reflection, reacting without explicitly realizing and without
            the meta-reflective ability to give an account of why one did so. The bicameral mind would thus lack
            metaconsciousness, autobiographical memory, and the capacity for executive "ego functions" such as
            deliberate mind-wandering and conscious introspection of mental content. When bicameral mentality as a
            method of social control was no longer adaptive in complex civilizations, this mental model was replaced by
            the conscious mode of thought which, Jaynes argued, is grounded in the acquisition of metaphorical language
            learned by exposure to narrative practice.</span>

          <span class="accordion__text">Jaynes built a case for this hypothesis that human brains existed in a bicameral
            state until as recently as 3,000 years ago by citing evidence from many diverse sources including historical
            literature. He took an interdisciplinary approach, drawing data from many different fields.[3] Jaynes
            asserted that, until roughly the times written about in Homer's Iliad, humans did not generally have the
            self-awareness characteristic of consciousness as most people experience it today. Rather, the bicameral
            individual was guided by mental commands believed to be issued by external "gods"—commands which were
            recorded in ancient myths, legends and historical accounts. This is exemplified not only in the commands
            given to characters in ancient epics but also the very muses of Greek mythology which "sang" the poems.
            According to Jaynes, the ancients literally heard muses as the direct source of their music and
            poetry.</span>

          <span class="accordion__text">Jaynes theorized that a shift from bicameral mentality marked the beginning of
            introspection and consciousness as we know it today. According to Jaynes, this bicameral mentality began
            malfunctioning or "breaking down" during the 2nd millennium BCE. He speculates that primitive ancient
            societies tended to collapse periodically: for example, Egypt's Intermediate Periods, as well as the
            periodically vanishing cities of the Mayas, as changes in the environment strained the socio-cultural
            equilibria sustained by this bicameral mindset.</span>
